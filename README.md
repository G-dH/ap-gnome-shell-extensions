### overlay-followfocus

This extension makes window focus in overlay view follow mouse so switching between windows can be really fast - it's enough to press the windows key on the keyboard, hover your mouse over the window you are interested in and press the windows key again. This has been inspired by how Mission Control in Mac OS works. I use it with native-window-placement and honestly don't think switching between applications could get any faster.
